memDB
=====
memDB is a really simple databaselike class.

You can create tables, columns and records.

There is no fancy errorchecking so you might run into some unexpected results if you're not careful.

memDB can import and export commaseparated text.

memDB can also load and save information from textstrings and files.

The textstring might be useful if the data is stored in another database.
